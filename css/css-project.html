                    <p>Molly a fun loving girl living in the suburbs with her mother and her little brother Justin, molly is a fantastic athlete won numerous awards in school from junior to senior high and was preparing for life in college. Molly has a boyfriend called Marcus whom she has known since kindergarten; Marcus is a great guy cool, calm, gentle, intelligent and has also excelled in sports. The two of them plan to get married and have kids after they graduate from college. Molly wants to study to become a Journalist, why Marcus wants to study to become a lawyer, the two of them have their lives planned out just the way they want it to be. Molly’s mom Sarah is a beautiful responsible woman with a lot of ambitions until she met molly’s dad Jonathan and got pregnant unexpectedly and since she grew up in a traditional family and was raised the old fashion way, having a child out of wedlock was simply unacceptable, so she got married to molly’s dad Jonathan but like the saying goes you can’t manipulate destiny, just a few months after molly was born Sarah noticed some strange things about Jonathan, like the way he mistreated her, coming home drunk at nights, he will call her names, hit her even when she was pregnant with molly. She will get complaints from people especially women on how he will sexually harass them, some filed complaints to the cops accusing him of rape and multiple times he got arrested but was never charged due to insufficient evidence. Sarah tried to put up with Jonathan’s abuse towards her as well as the embarrassment of him being reported for rape to the authorities by several women and the disgust of the possibility she could be married to a rapist. But when she starts to notice other strange behaviours about him like the way he looks at molly especially when she was becoming a teenager and the things he will say about molly, inappropriate things about her sexuality, she begins to consider divorcing him. Sarah spoke to her parents about Jonathan’s odd behaviours, they didn’t take it seriously and when she told them she is considering divorcing him, they reminded her of how much of a sin it will be to get a divorce because of their religious beliefs; they completely talked her out of it. But Sarah was more concerned about her daughter’s safety than her parent’s beliefs. Sarah tried to get Jonathan to get psychological help but instead he hit her and rape her, the following day she drove to the police station to report him for what he did but just when she was about to get out of her car and go into the police station, she thought of her daughter molly, knowing she can’t financially take care of her alone, and also thinking that her parents the only people she can count on for support my not understand why she did what she was about to do, not to mention that they barely have enough to support themselves talk less of her and her daughter molly, so she changed her mind and drove back home. But on one night molly just turned nine and Sarah woke up turned to Jonathan’s side of the bed and noticed he wasn’t laying there like he was supposed to, she felt uneasy about it so she decided to go look for him she got to the hallway and noticed that her daughter’s bedroom door was open which she found odd, so she went into the room to know why, upon entering the room she sees Jonathan, sitting by the bedside of molly’s bed staring at molly in an inappropriate manner and just when he was about to roll down the blanket molly was covered in, Sarah screamed  at him asking him to get out, molly woke up to her mom’s screaming and sees her father just standing by her bed and her mother very upset, Jonathan walks out of molly’s bedroom quickly, molly not knowing what was going on got confused and asked her mom what she was screaming for, but Sarah didn’t want to tell her, Sarah simply hugged her daughter and told her that everything will be alright that she’s safe now and can go back to sleep. Sarah fearing for her daughter’s safety decided to spend the night with her to ensure that her husband Jonathan will not return to molly’s bedroom. </p>
