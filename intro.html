            <h3>Learning to code from scratch</h3>
            <span>By Jude Obieze</span>

            <p>I never knew a thing about coding until i was introduced to it by a friend,
                and ever since its been taking up most of my time. I can't say i regret it
                because i dont, on the contratry, its one of the most fun and interesting things 
                i have done in a long time, and considering the career opportuinity that comes
                with it, which is greatly rewarding financially</p>
